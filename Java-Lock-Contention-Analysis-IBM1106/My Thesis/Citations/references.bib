abstract = {Concurrent code commonly uses locks. Choosing between simpler but less scalable and more sophisticated but error-prone locking mechanisms is difficult during development. Therefore, lock contention analysis at run-time is crucial to aid such decisions. We present a novel sampling-based approach for collecting detailed information on lock contention in Java applications by using the Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface (JVMTI) and bytecode instrumentation. We support both intrinsic locks as well as Java.util.concurrent locks. Moreover, we can determine not only where contention occurs but also where it is caused. With a mean run-time overhead of about 5%, we consider our approach suitable for use in production environments.},

abstract = {Continuous numerical is a type of data which often used for unsupervised learning such as clustering. However, this valuable data often provided in a small amount because it is hard to obtain, expensive, required an expert to collect them, or not available because it contains confidential information that cannot be published. These limited data situations can be an obstacle for processing and analyzing data or restrain clustering related research in general. Therefore, there is a need to be an alternative that can replace or increase the amount of data. The proposed method is generating synthetic continuous numerical data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This study used two GAN architectures (GAN and CGAN) and focused on unlabeled continuous numerical data to provide replacement or additional data for the clustering task. The Quality of synthetic data was measured using the accuracy of the xgboost algorithm in classifying real and synthetic data. When the xgboost accuracy of perfectly realistic data is 50%, synthetic data based on CGAN achieving 63%. The result of this study shows that GAN can generate data similar enough and not significantly different from the real data.},

The paper reviews those specific properties of this method that are important for identification of clusters in the original multidimensional data. First, there is described an artificial data set which clearly points to a certain drawback of the original RadViz mapping. To resolve the identified problem there are suggested 2 minor modifications of the RadViz algorithm. Finally, it is proved that application of both suggested modifications guarantees that the upper mentioned problem does not re-appear.

abstract = {Multi-threaded programs are pervasive, yet difficult to write. Missing proper synchronization leads to correctness bugs and over synchronization leads to performance problems. To improve the correctness and efficiency of multi-threaded software, we need a better understanding of synchronization challenges faced by real-world developers. This paper studies the code repositories of open-source multi-threaded software projects to obtain a broad and indepth view of how developers handle synchronizations. We first examine how critical sections are changed when software evolves by checking over 250,000 revisions of four representative open-source software projects. The findings help us answer questions like how often synchronization is an afterthought for developers; whether it is difficult for developers to decide critical section boundaries and lock variables; and what are real-world over-synchronization problems. We then conduct case studies to better understand (1) how critical sections are changed to solve performance problems (i.e. over-synchronization issues) and (2) how software changes lead to synchronization-related correctness problems (i.e. concurrency bugs). This in-depth study shows that tool support is needed to help developers tackle over-synchronization problems; it also shows that concurrency bug avoidance, detection, and testing can be improved through better awareness of code revision history.},

abstract = {Concurrency fault are difficult to find because they usually occur under specific thread interleavings. Fault-detection tools in this area find data-access patterns among thread interleavings, but they report benign patterns as well as actual faulty patterns. Traditional fault-localization techniques have been successful in identifying faults in sequential, deterministic programs, but they cannot detect faulty data-access patterns among threads. This paper presents a new dynamic fault-localization technique that can pinpoint faulty data-access patterns in multi-threaded concurrent programs. The technique monitors memory-access sequences among threads, detects data-access patterns associated with a program's pass/fail results, and reports dataaccess patterns with suspiciousness scores. The paper also presents the description of a prototype implementation of the technique in Java, and the results of an empirical study we performed with the prototype on several Java benchmarks. The empirical study shows that the technique can effectively and efficiently localize the faults for our subjects. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book." -Martin Buchholz JDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems "For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore's Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl's Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. Java Concurrency in Practice provides you with the concepts and techniques needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today's-and tomorrow's-systems." -Doron Rajwan Research Scientist, Intel Corp "This is the book you need if you're writing-or designing, or debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating-multithreaded Java programs. If you've ever had to synchronize a method and you weren't sure why, you owe it to yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover." -Ted Neward Author of Effective Enterprise Java "Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance." -Kirk Pepperdine CTO, JavaPerformanceTuning.com "This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important now that Moore's Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book will show you how to do it." -Dr. Cliff Click Senior Software Engineer, Azul Systems "I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers. Brian's book is the most readable on the topic of threading and concurrency in Java, and deals with this difficult subject with a wonderful hands-on approach. This is a book I am recommending to all my readers of The Java Specialists' Newsletter, because it is interesting, useful, and relevant to the problems facing Java developers today." -Dr. Heinz Kabutz The Java Specialists' Newsletter "I've focused a career on simplifying simple problems, but this book ambitiously and effectively works to simplify a complex but critical subject: concurrency. Java Concurrency in Practice is revolutionary in its approach, smooth and easy in style, and timely in its delivery-it's destined to be a very important book." -Bruce Tate Author of Beyond Java "Java Concurrency in Practice is an invaluable compilation of threading know-how for Java developers. I found reading this book intellectually exciting, in part because it is an excellent introduction to Java's concurrency API, but mostly because it captures in a thorough and accessible way expert knowledge on threading not easily found elsewhere." -Bill Venners Author of Inside the Java Virtual Machine Threads are a fundamental part of the Java platform. As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In Java Concurrency in Practice, the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them. However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. Java Concurrency in Practice arms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications. Rather than simply offering an inventory of concurrency APIs and mechanisms, it provides design rules, patterns, and mental models that make it easier to build concurrent programs that are both correct and performant.

abstract = {Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},

In this analysis, the generated data is evaluated as a test set (against a model trained on real data points) as well as a training set to train classification models.

With such a huge number of deployed IoT devices, Cyber-Physical System (CPS) calls for powerful distributed infrastructures to supply big data computing, intelligence, and storage services. With the increasingly complex distributed software infrastructures, new intricate bugs continue to manifest, causing huge economic loss. Synchronization performance problems, which means that improper synchronizations may degrade the performance and even lead to service exception, heavily influence the entire distributed cluster, imperiling the reliability of the system. As one kind of performance problems, the synchronization performance problems are acknowledged as difficult to diagnosis and fix. We collect 26 performance issues in three real-world distributed systems: HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, and HBase, and do analysis on their root cause, fix strategy, and algorithm complexity in order to understand these synchronization performance bugs better. Then, we implement a static detection tool including critical section identifier, loop identifier, inner loop identifier, expensive loop identifier, and pruning component. After that, we evaluate our detection tool on these three distributed systems with sampled bugs. In the evaluation, our detection tool accurately finds out all the target bugs. Besides, it points out more new potential performance problems than the previous works. With the strict performance overhead, our detection tool is proved to be greatly efficient.},

Locks are more convenient and clear than lock-free operations (for example, transactional memory) for multi-core programmers. However, lock contention has been recognized as a typical impediment to the performance of shared-memory parallel programs. This paper mainly discusses two important reasons that cause lock contention, including large critical sections and frequent lock requests. For current solutions, it is hard for programmers to find the locations of large critical sections and good scheme to reduce lock contentions on hot critical sections. This paper proposes FFlocker, a series of runtime solutions that reduce lock contention caused by the two issues. FFlocker includes a profiling algorithm to find the locations of large critical sections. Based on the profiling scheme, it binds the threads acquiring the same locks onto the same core. We evaluate our techniques with three benchmarks. The results show that FFlocker offers better performance than Function Flow and OpenMP.},

abstract = {Whether in the realm of software or hardware, datasets representing the state of systems are mostly imbalanced. This imbalance is because these systems' reliability requirements make the occurrence of an anomaly a rare phenomenon. Hence, most datasets on anomaly detection have a relatively small percentage that captures the anomaly. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have shown promising results in image generation tasks. Therefore, in this research work, we build on conditional GANs (CGAN) to generate plausible distributions of a given profile to solve the challenge of data imbalance in anomaly detection tasks and present a novel framework for anomaly detection. Firstly, we learn the pattern of the minority class data samples using a single class CGAN. Secondly, we use the knowledge base of the single class CGAN to generate samples that augment the minority class samples so that a binary class CGAN can train on the typical and malicious profiles with a balanced dataset. This approach inherently eliminates the bias imposed on algorithms from the dataset and results in a robust framework with improved generalization. Thirdly, the binary class CGAN generates a knowledge base that we use to construct the cluster-based anomaly detector. During testing, we do not use the single class CGAN, thereby providing us with a lean and efficient algorithm for anomaly detection that can do anomaly detection on semi-supervised and non-parametric multivariate data.We test the framework on logs and image-based anomaly detection datasets with class imbalance.We compare the performance of AD-CGAN with GAN-derived and non-GAN-derived state of the art algorithms on benchmark datasets. AD-CGAN outperforms most of the algorithms in the standard metrics of Precision, Recall, and F-1 Score. Where AD-CGAN does not perform better in the parameters used, it has the advantage of being lightweight. Therefore, it can be deployed for both online and offline anomaly detection tasks since it does not use an input sample inversion strategy.},

abstract = {Concurrent programming has become a necessity in order to benefit from recent advances in processor design. However, implementing correct and scalable locking for accessing shared resources remains a challenge. Examining lock contention in an application at runtime is vital to determine where more sophisticated but error-prone locking pays off. In this paper, we present a novel approach for analyzing lock contention in Java applications by tracing locking events in the Java Virtual Machine. Unlike common methods, our approach observes not only when a thread is blocked on a lock, but also which other thread blocked it by holding that lock, and records both their call chains. This reveals the causes of lock contention instead of showing only its symptoms. We describe the techniques which we use to efficiently record trace events, metadata, and call chains. We present a versatile tool for the analysis of the traces which enables users to identify locking bottlenecks and their characteristics in an effective way. We implemented our approach in the widely used HotSpot Virtual Machine, and with a mean runtime overhead of 7.8%, we consider it efficient enough to monitor production systems.},

The relative execution time overheads of the performance tools are illustrated for the DaCapo-bach-9.12 benchmarks with Open-JDK9 on an Intel Xeon E5-2690, running Ubuntu 16.04. Whereas sampling based tools can have up to 25% slowdown using 4kHz frequency, our tool bcc-Java has a geometric mean of less than 5%. Only for the avrora benchmark, bcc-Java has a significant overhead (37%) due to an unusually high number of futex system calls. Finally, we provide a discussion on the recommended approaches to solve specific performance use-case scenarios.},

abstract = {This paper presents and evaluates a set of analyses designed to reduce synchronization overhead in Java programs. Monitor-based synchronization in Java often causes significant overhead, accounting for 5–10% of total execution time in our benchmark applications. To reduce this overhead, programmers often try to eliminate unnecessary lock operations by hand. Such manual optimizations are tedious, error-prone, and often result in poorly structured and less reusable programs. Our approach replaces manual optimizations with static analyses that automatically find and remove unnecessary synchronization from Java programs. These analyses optimize cases where a monitor is entered multiple times by a single thread, where one monitor is nested within another, and where a monitor is accessible by only one thread. A partial implementation of our analyses eliminates up to 70% of synchronization overhead and improves running time by up to 5% for several already hand-optimized benchmarks. Thus, our automated analyses have the potential to significantly improve the performance of Java applications while enabling programmers to design simpler and more reusable multithreaded code.},

abstract = {Today, Java is regularly used to implement large multithreaded server-class applications that use locks to protect access to shared data. However, understanding the impact of locks on the performance of a system is complex, and thus the use of locks can impede the progress of threads on configurations that were not anticipated by the developer, during specific phases of the execution. In this paper, we propose Free Lunch, a new lock profiler for Java application servers, specifically designed to identify, in-vivo, phases where the progress of the threads is impeded by a lock. Free Lunch is designed around a new metric, critical section pressure (CSP), which directly correlates the progress of the threads to each of the locks. Using Free Lunch, we have identified phases of high CSP, which were hidden with other lock profilers, in the distributed Cassandra NoSQL database and in several applications from the DaCapo 9.12, the SPECjvm-2008 and the SPECjbb2005 benchmark suites. Our evaluation of Free Lunch shows that its overhead is never greater than 6%, making it suitable for in-vivo use. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

@article{Yu2018,
abstract = {Developing concurrent software that is both correct and efficient is challenging. Past research has proposed various techniques that support developers in finding, understanding, and repairing concurrency-related correctness problems, such as missing or incorrect synchronization. In contrast, existing work provides little support for dealing with concurrency-related performance problems, such as unnecessary or inefficient synchronization. This paper presents SyncProf, a profiling approach that helps in identifying, localizing, and repairing performance bottlenecks in concurrent programs. The approach consists of a sequence of dynamic analyses that reason about relevant code locations with increasing precision while narrowing down performance problems and gathering data for avoiding them. A key novelty is a graph-based representation of relations between critical sections, which is the basis for computing the performance impact of a critical section and for identifying the root cause of a bottleneck. Once a bottleneck is identified, SyncProf searches for a suitable optimization strategy to avoid the problem, increasing the level of automation when repairing performance bottlenecks over a traditional, manual approach. We evaluate SyncProf on 25 versions of eleven C/C++ projects with both known and previously unknown synchronization bottlenecks. The results show that SyncProf effectively localizes the root causes of these bottlenecks with higher precision than a state of the art lock contention profiler, and that it suggests valuable strategies to repair the bottlenecks.},

@article{Huang2012,
abstract = {Multithreaded programming relies on locks to ensure the consistency of shared data. Lock contention is the main reason of low parallel efficiency and poor scalability of multithreaded programs. Lock profiling is the primary approach to detect lock contention. Prior lock profiling tools are able to track lock behaviors but directly store profiling data into local memory regardless of the memory interference on targeted programs. In this paper, we find that the memory interference is nontrivial and can significantly affect programs' execution as thread number increases. To address this problem, we propose a hardware assisted lock profiling mechanism (HaLock) which leverages a specific hardware memory tracing tool (HMTT) to record large amount of profiling data with negligible overhead and impact on even large scale multithreaded programs. Experimental results show that HaLock incurs only about 14.8% additional L3 cache misses and 34.3% extra memory requests for a lock-intensive workload (bodytrack of PARSEC benchmark) with 512 threads, while the previous state of the art low-overhead approach causes 25.9% additional L3 cache misses and 73.8% additional memory requests. Compared with HaLock's profiling data, we find that the lock behaviors obtained by the state of art lock profiling tools have substantial distortions, resulting in non-negligible inaccuracy problems.

abstract = {Many programs exploit shared-memory parallelism using multithreading. Threaded codes typically use locks to coordinate access to shared data. In many cases, contention for locks reduces parallel efficiency and hurts scalability. Being able to quantify and attribute lock contention is important for understanding where a multithreaded program needs improvement. This paper proposes and evaluates three strategies for gaining insight into performance losses due to lock contention. First, we consider using a straightforward strategy based on call stack profiling to attribute idle time and show that it fails to yield insight into lock contention. Second, we consider an approach that builds on a strategy previously used for analyzing idleness in work-stealing computations; we show that this strategy does not yield insight into lock contention. Finally, we propose a new technique for measurement and analysis of lock contention that uses data associated with locks to blame lock holders for the idleness of spinning threads. Our approach incurs < 5% overhead on a quantum chemistry application that makes extensive use of locking (65M distinct locks, a maximum of 340K live locks, and an average of 30K lock acquisitions per second per thread) and attributes lock contention to its full static and dynamic calling contexts. Our strategy, implemented in HPCTOOLKIT, is fully distributed and should scale well to systems with large core counts. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},
